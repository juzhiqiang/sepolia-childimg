# Generated Files Directory

This directory contains files automatically generated by The Graph CLI when you run `npm run codegen`.

## Generated Structure (after running codegen):

```
generated/
├── ChildImg/
│   ├── ChildImg.ts          # Contract bindings and types
│   └── schema.ts            # Schema entity types
└── schema.ts                # GraphQL schema bindings
```

## Important Notes:

- **DO NOT** edit files in this directory manually
- These files are regenerated each time you run `npm run codegen`
- Files are generated from:
  - `abis/ChildImg.json` → Contract bindings
  - `schema.graphql` → Entity types
  - `subgraph.yaml` → Configuration

## To generate these files:

```bash
npm run codegen
```

## Import paths in your handlers:

```typescript
// Generated contract bindings
import {
  Approval as ApprovalEvent,
  ApprovalForAll as ApprovalForAllEvent,
  Transfer as TransferEvent,
  ChildImg
} from "../generated/ChildImg/ChildImg"

// Generated schema types  
import {
  Approval,
  ApprovalForAll,
  Transfer,
  Token,
  User
} from "../generated/schema"
```

This directory will be created automatically when you first run the codegen command.
